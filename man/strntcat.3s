.TH STRNTCAT 3S  2022-08-18 "GNU" "-"
.SH NAME
strntcat, strtcat - size-bounded string concatenation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \N'34'strtnt.h\N'34' 
.PP
.BI "int strntcat(char *" dst ", size_t " dstsize ", const char *" src );
.PP
.BI "int strtcat(char *" dst ", size_t " dstsize ", const char *" src );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strntcat()
and
.BR strtcat()
functions append the string pointed to by
.IR src 
to the  array  pointed to by
.IR dst ,
overwriting its terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq), then add a terminating null byte. The full size of the destination buffer
.IR dst 
is
.IR dstsize .
.PP
The
.BR strtcat()
function specifies that truncation is allowed. When truncation is not allowed, the
.BR strntcat()
function should be used.
.PP
Concatenation is actually made if the remaining size of the destination buffer pointed to by
.IR dst 
is large enough or the 
.BR strtcat()
function is chosen. When the remaining size is too small and the 
.BR strtcat()
function is chosen, only 
.IR dstsize - strlen(dst)  - 1
characters of
.IR src
are appened and a terminating null byte is added. After concatenation, the final string pointed to by
.IR dst
is always terminated with a null byte and its length is not more than
.IR dstsize - 1 .
.PP
The 
.BR strntcat() 
and 
.BR strtcat() 
functions store a well-formed string (i.e. a string with a terminating null byte) into the buffer pointed to by 
.IR dst 
or leave this buffer unchanged.
.PP
The destination buffer pointed to by
.IR dst 
remains unchanged if one of these conditions is realized:
.IP * 2
.IR dst
is a NULL pointer or the buffer pointed to by
.IR dst
contains a bad-formed string (i.e. a string without a terminating null byte).
.IP * 2
.IR dstsize 
is equal to 0.
.IP * 2 
.IR  src 
is a NULL pointer or the length of the string pointed to by 
.IR src
is equal to 0.
.IP * 2 
The 
.BR strntcat() 
function is used and the remaining size in the destination buffer pointed to by 
.IR dst
is too small.
.PP
The behavior of the 
.BR strntcat() 
and 
.BR strtcat() 
functions is undefined if:
.IP * 2
.IR dst 
and 
.IR src 
overlap.
.IP * 2 
.IR dstsize 
is different to 0 and does not correspond to the actual size of the destination buffer pointed to by 
.IR dst .
.IP * 2 
.IR src 
is a bad-formed string.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return:
.IP * 2
A non negative integer after success:
.TP
.in +4
.B ONOTRUNC
.in +6
No truncation was done during the concatenation: 
.BR strtcat() , 
.BR strntcat() .
.TP
.in +4 
.B OTRUNC
.in +6
An allowed truncation was done during the concatenation: 
.BR strtcat() .
.IP * 2
A negative integer after error:
.TP
.in +4
.B EDSTNUL
.in +6
.IR dst
is a NULL pointer: 
.BR strtcat() ,
.BR strntcat() .
.TP
.in +4
.B EDSTSZ0
.in +6
.IR dstsize
is equal to 0: 
.BR strtcat() , 
.BR strntcat() .
.TP
.in +4
.B EDSTBF
.in +6
.IR dst
is a bad-formed string:
.BR strtcat() ,
.BR strntcat() .
.TP
.in +4
.B ESRCNUL 
.in +6
.IR src 
is a NULL pointer: 
.BR strtcat() , 
.BR strntcat() .
.TP
.in +4
.B ETRUNC
.in +6 
.IR dstzise 
is too small and truncation is not allowed: 
.BR strntcat() .
.SH PORTABILITY
The
.BR strntcat()
and
.BR strtcat()
functions conform to C89.
.SH NOTES
These functions are designed to be an alternative to the
.BR strcat()
function and to replace the 
.BR strlcat() 
and 
.BR strcat_s() 
functions. They are easier to use, more robust, more consistent and less error prone.
.PP
They provide enough information to process an error condition:
.PP
.in +4
.nf
  /* Truncation is allowed */
  if ( (ret = strtcat(dst,dstsize,src)) < 0 )  
     process_error(ret) ;
